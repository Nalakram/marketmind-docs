# Security Practices

MarketMind implements strong security practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of both user data and trading operations.

---

## Data Security

- **Local Data Processing:** All financial data processing occurs locally on the user's device.
- **Secure Storage:** Users are advised to apply OS-level disk encryption (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault) to protect local MarketMind data.
- **No Personal Data Collection:** MarketMind collects no personal identifiable information (PII).

## Application Security

- **gRPC Communication Security:** All internal communication uses gRPC with TLS encryption.
- **Authentication:** JavaFX-based GUI login with secure credential validation and session management.
- **Structured Logging:** Python components leverage `structlog` for structured, key-value logs without leaking sensitive data.
- **Memory Safety:** The C++20 backend utilizes memory-safe practices like `std::span` and smart pointers.
- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks and ensure safe execution.

## Development and Deployment Security

- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated tools like Dependabot and CodeQL detect known security issues in dependencies and source code.
- **Extensive Testing:** CI/CD pipelines include security-relevant unit and integration tests across Python, C++, and Java components.
- **Open-Source Auditability:** Users and the community are encouraged to review the source code to verify security claims.

## Known Limitations and Future Improvements

| Limitation | Planned Improvement |
|------------|---------------------|
| Data at rest not encrypted by default | Considering optional lightweight encryption |
| No binary signing | Exploring GPG-signed releases and SLSA compliance |
| No MFA | Will consider adding MFA if cloud features are introduced |
