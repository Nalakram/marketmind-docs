# Regulatory Compliance

MarketMind is designed with regulatory alignment in mind. While MarketMind itself does not provide investment advice, it supports compliance best practices for data handling, privacy, and risk management in financial environments.

---

## Financial Regulations

- **Data Source Compliance:** MarketMind exclusively uses publicly available data or data obtained via user-authorized APIs (e.g., Interactive Brokers API).  
- **Transparent Models:** Model interpretability (using SHAP values) helps analysts and regulatory bodies understand and audit the reasoning behind trading decisions.

---

## Privacy and Data Protection Compliance

- **GDPR & CCPA Alignment:**  
MarketMindâ€™s privacy-first architecture aligns with GDPR and CCPA by design. No personal data is collected, minimizing regulatory exposure.

- **User-Controlled Local Storage:**  
All data remains local to the user, empowering full control over storage, retention, and deletion.

## Data Usage Transparency

MarketMind maintains clear and open communication about data usage practices:

| Topic          | Approach                  |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Personal Data  | Not collected             |
| Financial Data | Used only for trading signals and analysis |
| Storage        | Local-only, not uploaded  |

## Security Compliance

MarketMind employs best practices aligned with industry standards for financial software:

- **TLS Encryption:** All API communications use secure protocols.
- **Secure Authentication:** Local authentication mechanisms protect access.
- **Dependency Management:** Automated vulnerability scanning for third-party libraries.
- **Internal Security Audits:** Regular review of sensitive modules.

---

## Operational Risk Management

MarketMind provides risk management tools (stop-loss, take-profit, etc.) to help users comply with responsible trading standards.

---

## Incident Response and Disclosure

We follow a responsible disclosure process for security incidents (see [[Security Practices](https://marketmind-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security_practices.html).) and will notify users in accordance with applicable laws if data-related incidents occur, though the local-only design minimizes this risk.

---

## Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation

We actively monitor changes in regulatory frameworks (e.g., SEC, GDPR, CCPA) and will adapt the platform accordingly to maintain compliance alignment.
