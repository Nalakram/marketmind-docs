# MarketMind Coding Standards

The following coding standards ensure high-quality, maintainable, and efficient development within the MarketMind project. Adherence to these guidelines promotes clarity, modularity, robustness, maintainability, testing rigor, performance optimization, security, and observability.

## 1. Clarity and Readability

- **Descriptive Naming**: Always use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes that clearly convey their purpose.
- **Style Consistency**: Adhere to the official style guides:
  - Python: [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
  - Java: [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
  - C++: [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
- **Documentation**: Include clear, concise comments explaining complex logic, especially algorithms and machine learning models.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Keep functions and methods concise, focusing each on a single task.

## 2. Modularity

- **Functional Organization**: Structure code clearly into modules or packages based on their functionality (e.g., data handling, model training, prediction logic, trading strategies).
- **Explicit Interfaces**: Define clear, documented interfaces between modules to minimize interdependencies and facilitate independent development.
- **Design Patterns**: Apply relevant design patterns (MVC, Observer, Factory) to improve code structure and reuse.

## 3. Robustness and Error Handling

- **Input Validation**: Ensure all inputs (financial data, user input, API responses) are rigorously validated.
- **Error Management**: Implement informative, user-friendly error handling that logs sufficient context without exposing sensitive information.
- **Resource Management**: Properly manage system resources by explicitly handling file closures, connection terminations, and memory management (e.g., smart pointers in C++).

## 4. Maintainability

- **Configuration Management**: Use external configuration files (`config.yaml`) to manage parameters, credentials, and API endpoints. Validate configurations with schema validation tools.
- **Code Reuse**: Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to maximize code reuse and minimize redundancy.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilize dependency injection techniques to enhance modularity and facilitate testing.

## 5. Testing and Validation

- **Unit Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests covering individual modules and functions, targeting at least 80% code coverage.
- **Integration Testing**: Conduct integration tests to ensure components interact correctly (e.g., data pipelines, model inference, trading executions).
- **Static Analysis**: Regularly run static analysis tools (CodeQL, Dependabot) to proactively identify and resolve code vulnerabilities and bugs.
- **Continuous Integration**: Leverage GitHub Actions for automated unit testing, linting, and code formatting upon every commit.
- **Code Reviews**: Regularly perform peer code reviews to ensure high code quality, adherence to standards, and knowledge sharing.

## 6. Performance and Scalability

- **Optimizations**: Focus optimization efforts on performance-critical modules, particularly inference backend and data processing tasks, ensuring responsiveness and low latency.
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Select optimal data structures and algorithms suited for high-frequency trading scenarios and large datasets.
- **Scalability**: Design MarketMind’s architecture to support scalability through modular, horizontally scalable components and clear performance benchmarks.

## 7. Security

- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all inputs to prevent vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
- **Sensitive Data Protection**: Store sensitive information (API keys, credentials) securely in local configuration files or environment variables, never hard-coded.
- **Secure Communication**: Implement secure gRPC communication (TLS) between application components.
- **Local Data Handling**: Process all sensitive financial data locally on user machines, aligning with MarketMind’s privacy-first policy.

## 8. Documentation

- **Comprehensive README**: Maintain an updated `README.md` with clear setup instructions, system overview, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
- **API Reference**: Provide detailed, auto-generated API documentation via Sphinx AutoAPI for Python, and Doxygen/Javadoc for C++ and Java.
- **Inline Documentation**: Use inline documentation consistently for complex code segments to facilitate long-term maintenance and readability.

## 9. Monitoring and Observability

- **Structured Logging**: Utilize structured logging (`structlog`) across Python modules to improve log readability, debugging capability, and auditing.
- **Performance Metrics**: Implement metrics collection for monitoring system health, performance bottlenecks, and operational efficiency.
- **Tracing**: Consider distributed tracing for debugging complex data pipelines and backend communications, enhancing observability and performance optimization.
